# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
Ensure server.js is running on your preferred port (default: 5000).

SQLite DB is stored locally in /db/tasks.db.

2️⃣ Frontend Setup
bash
Copy
Edit
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
Opens the React app at http://localhost:3000.

🔄 Frontend Context API Logic
✅ TaskProvider
Provides tasks, addTask, updateTask, deleteTask

Saves data to localStorage

✅ TaskContext
js
Copy
Edit
// src/context/TaskContext.js
import { createContext } from 'react';
const TaskContext = createContext();
export default TaskContext;
📸 UI Preview (Optional - Add Screenshot)
You can include screenshots of:

🧑 User input form

✅ Task form with task list

📱 Mobile layout

⚠️ Common Errors & Fixes
Error Message	Cause	Fix
Element type is invalid: got undefined	TaskProvider or TaskContext not exported/imported properly	Export TaskContext in TaskContext.js, and TaskProvider in TaskProvider.js
Tasks not persisting	localStorage was not set up or effect hook missing	Use useEffect(() => { ... }, [tasks]) and JSON.stringify/parse correctly
